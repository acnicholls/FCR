# FCR
Fast Car Rental
## Purpose
Fast Car Rental is a project that I did in Classic ASP for a college project.
## Design
### server side
The application is written in vbscript as active server pages that generate HTML to send to the client.  The database is MS Access, and the application uses an ADODB connection to the file to manage the data within. Logs are kept of the rental and return procedures, and the user can add new cars.
### client side
the client side program uses vbscript in the browser to navigate the user and send updates to the server.
##### Note: vbscript is only usable on Internet Explorer
## Working version
